Eusebius divided the Gospel into chapters and then created tables that allowed readers to find where a given episode in the life of Christ was located in each of the Gospels. The canon tables were traditionally included in the prefatory material in most medieval copies of the Vulgate text of the Gospels. The tables in the Book of Kells, however, are almost unusable because the scribe condensed the tables in such a way as to make them confused. In addition, the corresponding chapter numbers were never inserted into the margins of the text, making it impossible to find the sections to which the canon tables refer. The reason for the omission remains unclear: the scribe may have planned to add the references upon the manuscript's completion, or he may have deliberately left them out so as not to spoil the appearance of pages.", "\n", "The ", " and ", " belong to a pre-Vulgate tradition of manuscripts.

Earlier manuscripts tend toward more narrow palettes: the Book of Durrow, for example, uses only four colours. As is usual with insular work, there was no use of ", " or ", " in the manuscript. The ", " for the illustrations included red and yellow ochre, green copper pigment (sometimes called ", "), indigo, and possibly ", ".", " These would have been imported from the Mediterranean region and, in the case of the lapis lazuli (also known as ", "), from northeast ", ".", " Though the presence of lapis lazuli has long been considered evidence of the great cost required to create the manuscript, recent examination of the pigments has shown that lapis lazuli was not used.", "\n", "The lavish illumination programme is far greater than any other surviving Insular Gospel book. There are ten surviving full-page illuminations including two ", ", three pages with the four ", ", a ", ", a miniature of the ", ", a miniature of Christ enthroned, and miniatures of the ", " and the ", ". There are thirteen surviving full pages of decorated text including pages for the first few words of each of the Gospels. Eight of the ten pages of the canon tables have extensive decoration. It is highly probable that there were other pages of miniature and decorated text that are now lost. In addition to these major pages, there are a host of smaller decorations and decorated initials throughout the text; in fact only two pages have no decoration.", "\n", "The extant folios of the manuscript start with the fragment of the glossary of Hebrew names. This fragment occupies the left-hand column of folio 1r. A miniature of the four evangelist symbols, now much abraded, make up the right-hand column. The miniature is oriented so that the volume must be turned ninety degrees to view it properly.", " The four evangelist symbols are a visual theme that runs throughout the book. They are almost always shown together to emphasise the doctrine of the four Gospels' unity of message.\n", "The unity of the Gospels is further emphasised by the decoration of the Eusebian canon tables. The canon tables themselves inherently illustrate the unity of the Gospels by organising corresponding passages from the Gospels. The Eusebian canon tables normally require twelve pages. In the Book of Kells, the makers of the manuscript planned for twelve pages (folios 1v through 7r) but for unknown reasons, condensed them into ten, leaving folios 6v and 7r blank. This condensation rendered the canon tables unusable. The decoration of the first eight pages of the canon tables is heavily influenced by early Gospel Books from the Mediterranean, where it was traditional to enclose the tables within an ", " (as seen in the ", ").", " The Kells manuscript presents this ", " in an Insular spirit, where the arcades are not seen as architectural elements but rather become stylised geometric patterns with Insular ornamentation. The four evangelist symbols occupy the spaces under and above the arches. The last two canon tables are presented within a grid. This presentation is limited to Insular manuscripts and was first seen in the Book of Durrow.", "\n", "The remainder of the book is broken into sections with the divisions set off by miniatures and full pages of decorated text. Each of the Gospels is introduced by a consistent decorative programme. The preliminary matter is treated as one section and introduced by a lavish decorative spread. In addition to the preliminaries and the Gospels, the \"second beginning\" of the Gospel of Matthew is also given its own introductory decoration.\n", "The preliminary matter is introduced by an ", " image of the ", " (folio 7v). This miniature is the first representation of the ", " in a Western manuscript. Mary is shown in an odd mixture of frontal and three-quarter pose. This miniature also bears a stylistic similarity to the carved image on the lid of ", " of 698. The iconography of the miniature may derive from an Eastern or Coptic icon.", "\n", "The miniature of the Virgin and Child faces the first page of text and is an appropriate preface to the beginning of the ", " of Matthew, which begins ", " (the birth of Christ in Bethlehem). The beginning page (", ") of the text of the ", " is decorated and contained within an elaborate frame. The two-page spread of the miniature and the text makes a vivid introductory statement for the prefatory material. The opening line of each of the sections of the preliminary matter is enlarged and decorated (see above for the ", " of Luke), but no other section of the preliminaries is given the same level of treatment as the beginning of the ", " of Matthew.", "\n", "The book was designed so that each of the Gospels would have an elaborate introductory decorative programme. Each Gospel was originally prefaced by a full page miniature containing the four evangelist symbols, followed by a blank page. Then came a portrait of the evangelist which faced the opening text of the Gospel which was given an elaborate decorative treatment.", " The Gospel of Matthew retains both its Evangelist portrait (", ") and its page of Evangelist symbols (folio 27r, see above). The Gospel of Mark is missing the Evangelist portrait but retains its Evangelist symbols page (", "). The Gospel of Luke is missing both the portrait and the Evangelist symbols page. The Gospel of John, like the Gospel of Matthew, retains both its portrait (folio 291v, see at right) and its Evangelist symbols page (", "). It can be assumed that the portraits for Mark and Luke and the symbols page for Luke at one time existed but have been lost.", " The use of all four of the Evangelist symbols in front of each Gospel is striking and was intended to reinforce the message of the unity of the Gospels.\n", "The ornamentation of the opening few words of each Gospel is lavish; their decoration is so elaborate that the text itself is almost illegible. The opening page (folio 29r) of Matthew may stand as an example. (See illustration at left.) The page consists of only two words: ", " (\"The book of the generation\"). The ", " of ", " is turned into a giant monogram which dominates the entire page. The ", " of ", " is presented as an interlaced ornament within the ", " of the ", " monogram.

The entire assemblage is contained within an elaborate border.", "\n", " The border and the letters themselves are further decorated with elaborate spirals and ", ", many of them zoomorphic. The opening words of Mark, ", " (\"The beginning of the Gospel\"), Luke, ", ", and John, ", " (\"In the beginning was the Word\"), are all given similar treatments. Although the decoration of these pages was most extensive in the Book of Kells, these pages were decorated in all the other Insular Gospel Books.", "\n", "The Gospel of Matthew begins with a ", ".

In Insular Gospel Books, the initial ", " monogram was enlarged and decorated. In the Book of Kells, this second beginning was given a decorative programme equal to those that preface the individual Gospels.", " Folio 32 verso has a miniature of Christ enthroned.

The letter chi dominates the page with one arm swooping across the majority of the page. The letter rho is snuggled underneath the arms of the chi. Both letters are divided into compartments which are lavishly decorated with knot work and other patterns. The background is likewise awash in a mass of swirling and knotted decoration. Within this mass of decoration are hidden animals and insects. Three angels arise from one of the cross arms of the chi.

In the Gospel of Mark, there are also two pages of decorated text (", ", \"Erat autem hora tercia\", and folio 187v, \"[Et Dominus] quidem [Iesus] postquam\"). The Gospel of Luke contains two pages of fully decorated text (folio 188v, \"Fuit in diebus Herodis \", and ", ", \"Una autem sabbati valde\"). Although these texts do not have miniatures associated with them, it is probable that miniatures were planned to accompany each of these texts and have either been lost or were never completed. In the Gospel of John, there is no surviving full page of decorated text,  apart from its incipit. However, in the other three Gospels, all the full pages of decorated text, except for folio 188c, which begins the Nativity narration, occur within the Passion narrative. However, since the missing folios of John contain the Passion narrative, it is likely that John contained full pages of decorated text that have been lost.", "\n", "The decoration of the book is not limited to the major pages. Scattered through the text are decorated initials and small figures of animals and humans often twisted and tied into complicated knots. Many significant texts, such as the ", " have decorated initials. The page containing text of the ", " in Matthew (", ") has a large miniature along the left margin of the page in which the letter ", " which begins each line is linked into an ornate chain. The genealogy of Christ found in the Gospel of Luke (", ") contains a similar miniature in which the word ", " is repeatedly linked along the left margin. Many of the small animals scattered throughout the text serve to mark a \"turn-in-the-path\" (that is, a place where a line is finished in a space above or below the original line). Many other animals serve to fill spaces left at the end of lines. No two of these designs are the same. No earlier surviving manuscript has this massive amount of decoration.\n", "The decorations are all high quality and often highly complex. In one decoration, which occupies a one-inch square piece of a page, there are 158 complex interlacements of white ribbon with a black border on either side. Some decorations can only be fully seen with magnifying glasses, although lenses of the required power are not known to have been available until hundreds of years after the book's completion. The complicated knot work and interweaving found in Kells and related manuscripts have many parallels in the metalwork and stone carving of the period.\n", "The book had a sacramental rather than educational purpose.

It is significant that the ", " state the book was stolen from the ", ", where the vessels and other accoutrements of the ", " were stored, rather than from the monastic library. Its design seems to take this purpose in mind; that is, the book was produced with appearance taking precedence over practicality. There are numerous uncorrected mistakes in the text.

Great Halls were considered redundant now that employers wished to live separately from their servants, and no longer ate with them in a Great Hall. All evidence and odours of cooking and staff were banished from the principal parts of the house. Employers began to live in fine airy rooms, above the ground floor, with privacy from their servants, who were now confined, unless required, to specifically delegated areas\u2014often the ground and uppermost attic floors. This was a period of great social change in British history, and the educated prided themselves on enlightenment and elegance.", "\n", "Belton was designed in the restrained almost ", "-inspired architecture of the time immediately before the full emergence in England of the ornate Baroque. The general form this architecture took was of severely symmetrical, often rectangular houses, with a ", " over the central bays. This almost rigid concept was to influence the design of innumerable houses, including Belton. Later to be known as the ", " style (from \"Carolus,\" the Latin name for the reigning monarch ", "), it was popular with the minor ", " and ", " for both their town and country houses until long after Charles II's death.", "\n", "Belton is faced with the local ", ", with a lighter ", " from ", " for the ", ".", " The \"H\"-shaped plan was a design which became popular in the late ", " period.

The new layout placed rooms back to back, creating a house two rooms deep. This became known as \"double pile\". As at Belton, this permitted rooms to be not just better lit and heated but also better accessed and related to each other, and with the greatest advantage of all\u2014greater privacy. On the construction side, the double room depth allowed the house to be more compact and under one, more easily constructed, roof, thus lowering building costs.\n", "The plan of the rooms at Belton was pass\u00e9 for a grand house of its time. Following the Restoration and the influx of European ideas, it had become popular for large houses to follow the continental fashion of a suite of ", " consisting of a ", ", dressing room, and bedroom proceeding from either side of a central ", " or hall.", " These rooms were permanently reserved for use by a high ranking guest, such as a visiting monarch. While Belton does have a saloon at its centre, ", " of state rooms of lessening grandeur do not flank it. The possible reason for this unusual layout is that, while the Brownlows possessed great wealth, their title was only a ", ", and their fortune was barely a century old. They would have been regarded as ", ", not ", ". As a result, building a suite of state rooms would have been in hope rather than anticipation of a royal guest.

The King occupied the \"Best bedchamber\", a large room with an adjoining closet, directly above the saloon, that led directly from the second floor Great Dining Chamber.", "\n", "This design followed the older style of having reception rooms and bedrooms scattered over the two main floors. The layout used followed Roger Pratt's theory that guest and family rooms should be quite separate.", " As a consequence of this philosophy, the family occupied the rooms on the first and second floors of the west and east wings, with the state rooms in the centre. The great staircase, designed to be grand and imposing, rose to the east side of the house, and formed part of the guest's state route from the Hall and Saloon on the first floor to the principal dining room and bedroom on the second.", "\n", "The principal entrance hall, reception and family bedrooms were placed on the ground and first floors above a low ", " containing service rooms.", " The two principal entrances to the mansion in the centre of both the north and south facades were accessed by external staircases, originally a single flared flight on the north side and a double staircase on the south, each of which have since been replaced by single broad flights of steps.", "\n", "The second floor has a matching ", ", with windows of equal value to those on the first floor below. The very latest innovation, ", ", was used on both floors. The semi-basement and ", " storey used the more old-fashioned ", " and ", " windows, indicating the lower status of the occupants of these floors. It was clearly emphasised from without that the two main floors of the house were purely for state and family use, and the staff and service areas were confined to the semi-basement and attic floors. This concept of keeping staff and domestic matters out of sight (when not required) was relatively new and had first been employed by Pratt in the design of ", " in Berkshire. The contemporary social commentator of the day ", " lauded back stairs, of which Belton has two examples (", " and ", " on plan), as one of the most important inventions of his day.", "\n", "The principal room is the large Marble Hall (", ") at the centre of the south front; this hall is the beginning of a grand procession of rooms, and corresponds to the former Great Parlour or ", " (", ") on the north front.

The main staircase, set to one side of the Marble Hall, is one of the few things at Belton which is asymmetrically placed. It has a robust plaster-work ceiling incorporating the Brownlow crest by the London plasterer Edward Goudge, \"now looked on as ye best master in England in his profession,\" William Winde reported in 1690.", "\n", "Bodily and spiritual needs were balanced symmetrically within the mansion: the kitchen (", ") and the chapel (", ") were both large two-storied halls, rising from the semi-basement to the first floor. This design not only provided a great and lofty space, but also allowed the servants to worship in the chapel without leaving the service floor, while their employers would worship from a private gallery, complete with fireplace, overlooking the chapel on the first floor.", "\n", "One of the most ", " features of the house is the ", " and ", " surmounting the roof, another element introduced to English architecture by Roger Pratt. The cupola at Belton does not light a lofty domed hall, as is often the case in Europe, but houses a staircase which gives access to a large viewing platform on top of a lead roof, concealed from the ground by the balustrade which tops the more conventional and visible ", " roof. From this vantage point, the owners of Belton could admire the perfect symmetry of their avenues and formal gardens spreading from the house.

The panelling was introduced to the room by the 3rd Earl Brownlow in 1876, when it was furnished as the principal dining room of the mansion. The room was initially created as a library in 1808 from the upper part of the earlier kitchen which had originally risen two stories.", " The West staircase (", ") was originally a service stairs, and would have been plainer in decor, but by the late nineteenth century it was in regular use by the family.", "\n", "Either side of the Marble Hall, lie the ", " (", ") and the ", " (", "), which contains a collection of early eighteenth century ", ".

The stairs rise in three flights around the west, north, and east walls to the former Great Dining Room above the Marble Hall. Thus the staircase served as an important state procession link between the three principal reception rooms of the house.

He commissioned the first detailed survey of Bodiam Castle in 1864, and undertook repairs to the tower at the southwest corner of the site, which had almost entirely collapsed.

Nearby hedges and fences were removed to provide an unobscured view of the castle. There were excavations in the interior, and a well was discovered in the basement of the southwest tower. Vegetation was cleared, stonework repaired, and the original floor level re-established throughout the castle.
