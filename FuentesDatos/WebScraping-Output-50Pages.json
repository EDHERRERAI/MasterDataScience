Most of the primary and secondary construction beams were of ponderosa pine. In addition to bulk materials, construction required other items in smaller quantities. Cordage was used for lashing roof elements together, and baskets and wood frames were needed for transporting ", " and rock. Other tools, such as digging sticks and hammerstones, were used in quantity; many discarded hammerstones have been found built into the wall interiors.", "\n", "Chetro Ketl's walls were constructed using three bulk materials: stone, clay-sand, and water. Two types of stone were used: a hard gray-brown tabular sandstone that forms the bench above Chaco Canyon's cliffs, and a softer, tan, massively bedded sandstone that forms the cliffs themselves. Chacoans preferred the harder, tabular stone as it was easier to shape, but much of it had to be dug up and levered out of the ground with wooden poles. Because the massive tan stone of the cliff faces was easier to procure, but much more difficult to work, the Chacoans probably used it only after the more easily quarried gray-brown stone beds had been depleted.", "\n", "The Chacoans used clay or clay-sand and water to make mud mortar. They obtained most of the material from canyon deposits, but some of the clays may have been collected from the base of the cliffs. Clay and clay-sand in soils or stream deposits were accessed by digging large pits, then mixing mortar in the pits and carrying the mix to the construction site in baskets. Water is scarce in Chaco Canyon and construction probably took place primarily during the late summer and early fall rainy season, when it was more readily available. Water was also collected from small reservoirs in the slick rock and deep wells in the bed of Chaco Wash.", "\n", "Only the most highly skilled Chacoans shaped and set stone; others carried supplies and mixed mortar. The width of a given wall was determined by its place in a structure. The first story of a two-story wall is always wider than the second. Chacoan walls are often called ", ", but only the widest walls had cores. The Chacoans tried to build walls with two flush faces, but because the stones were typically quite small, to build a wider wall they built up a space between the two faces; this spacing is often called the core. In most walls, the core consisted of roughly shaped stone or rubble laid at the same time as the two faces. In others, the faces were built up independently, and the core packed between them. Chacoan walls derive their stability from the degree of contact between stones in the faces and the width of the wall itself, not from the strength of the core.", "\n", "Chacoan wall faces are typically called \"veneers\", but they were integral load-bearing elements rather than decorative overlays. The veneers are known for their attention to coursing and detail, and various styles have become synonymous with Chacoan building. Depending on the facing style, the joints between the stones would be filled with ", " or chinks, set in mud mortar; or the coursing could alternate between larger stones and several courses of smaller tablets. Good veneer minimized the amount of exposed mortar, which reduced maintenance, maximized stone contact, and increased the strength of the wall. It also reduced the possibility of structural failure. Aside from structural considerations, some veneers are the result of highly skilled masons working within well-developed craft traditions. Recurring veneer patterns may indicate a widespread style used during a particular period, or they may suggest the work of a specific social group or line of builders.", "\n", "Doors and vents often had sills of carefully ground flat stone slabs and lintels constructed from a row of thin wood beams. Chacoan masons also frequently included intramural beams \u2013 horizontal logs completely enclosed in the wall core \u2013 which were probably intended to reduce horizontal deformation of the wall.", " The interior walls of great houses were typically covered in a rock veneer.

It was the chosen style for numerous houses in both town and country, although Holkham is exceptional for both its severity of design and for being closer than most in its adherence to Palladio's ideals.\n", "Although Thomas Coke oversaw the project, he delegated the on-site architectural duties to the local Norfolk architect Matthew Brettingham, who was employed as the on-site clerk of works. Brettingham was already the estate architect, and was in receipt of ", "50 a year (about 8,000 pounds per year in 2020 terms", ") in return for \"taking care of his Lordship's buildings\".", " He was also influential in the design of the mansion, although he attributed the design of the Marble Hall to Coke himself. William Kent was mainly responsible for the interiors of the Southwest pavilion, or family wing block, particularly the Long Library. Kent produced a variety of alternative exteriors, suggesting a far richer decoration than Coke wanted. Brettingham described the building of Holkham as \"the great work of [my life]\", and when he published his \"The Plans and Elevations of the late Earl of Leicester's House at Holkham\", he immodestly described himself as sole architect, making no mention of Kent's involvement.

Holkham is a Palladian house, and yet even by Palladian standards the external appearance is austere and devoid of ", ". This can almost certainly be traced to Coke himself. The on-site, supervising architect, Matthew Brettingham, related that Coke required and demanded \"commodiousness\", which can be interpreted as comfort. Hence rooms that were adequately lit by one window, had only one, as a second might have improved the external appearance but could have made a room cold or draughty. As a result, the few windows on the piano nobile, although symmetrically placed and balanced, appear lost in a sea of brickwork; albeit these yellow bricks were cast as exact replicas of ancient Roman bricks expressly for Holkham.

Multiple factors were considered when choosing a site, balancing between the need for a defendable position with other considerations such as proximity to resources. For instance many castles are located near Roman roads, which remained important transport routes in the Middle Ages, or could lead to the alteration or creation of new road systems in the area. Where available it was common to exploit pre-existing defences such as building with a Roman fort or the ramparts of an Iron Age hillfort. A prominent site that overlooked the surrounding area and offered some natural defences may also have been chosen because its visibility made it a symbol of power.", " Urban castles were particularly important in controlling centres of population and production, especially with an invading force, for instance in the aftermath of the Norman Conquest of England in the 11th\u00a0century the majority of royal castles were built in or near towns.", "\n", "As castles were not simply military buildings but centres of administration and symbols of power, they had a significant impact on the surrounding landscape. Placed by a frequently-used road or river, the ", " ensured that a lord would get his due toll money from merchants. Rural castles were often associated with mills and field systems due to their role in managing the lord's estate,", " which gave them greater influence over resources.", " Others were adjacent to or in royal forests or deer parks and were important in their upkeep. Fish ponds were a luxury of the lordly elite, and many were found next to castles. Not only were they practical in that they ensured a water supply and fresh fish, but they were a status symbol as they were expensive to build and maintain.", "\n", "Although sometimes the construction of a castle led to the destruction of a village, such as at ", " in England, it was more common for the villages nearby to have grown as a result of the presence of a castle.

They were usually located near any existing town defences, such as Roman walls, although this sometimes resulted in the demolition of structures occupying the desired site. In ", ", 166\u00a0houses were destroyed to clear space for the castle, and in York agricultural land was flooded to create a moat for the castle. As the military importance of urban castles waned from their early origins, they became more important as centres of administration, and their financial and judicial roles.", " When the Normans invaded Ireland, Scotland, and Wales in the 11th\u00a0and 12th\u00a0centuries, settlement in those countries was predominantly non-urban, and the foundation of towns was often linked with the creation of a castle.", "\n", "The location of castles in relation to high status features, such as fish ponds, was a statement of power and control of resources.

Moreover, the gunports were impractical and unlikely to have been effective.", "\n", "As a static structure, castles could often be avoided. Their immediate area of influence was about 400 metres (1,300\u00a0ft) and their weapons had a short range even early in the age of artillery. However, leaving an enemy behind would allow them to interfere with communications and make raids. Garrisons were expensive and as a result often small unless the castle was important.", " Cost also meant that in peacetime garrisons were smaller, and small castles were manned by perhaps a couple of watchmen and gate-guards. Even in war, garrisons were not necessarily large as too many people in a defending force would strain supplies and impair the castle's ability to withstand a long siege. In 1403, a force of 37\u00a0archers successfully defended ", " against two assaults by Owain Glynd\u0175r's allies during a long siege, demonstrating that a small force could be effective.", "\n", "Early on, manning a castle was a feudal duty of vassals to their magnates, and magnates to their kings, however this was later replaced with paid forces.", " A garrison was usually commanded by a constable whose peacetime role would have been looking after the castle in the owner's absence. Under him would have been knights who by benefit of their military training would have acted as a type of officer class. Below them were archers and bowmen, whose role was to prevent the enemy reaching the walls as can be seen by the positioning of arrowslits.", "\n", "If it was necessary to seize control of a castle an army could either launch an assault or lay siege. It was more efficient to starve the garrison out than to assault it, particularly for the most heavily defended sites. Without relief from an external source, the defenders would eventually submit. Sieges could last weeks, months, and in rare cases years if the supplies of food and water were plentiful. A long siege could slow down the army, allowing help to come or for the enemy to prepare a larger force for later.", " Such an approach was not confined to castles, but was also applied to the fortified towns of the day.", " On occasion, siege castles would be built to defend the besiegers from a sudden ", " and would have been abandoned after the siege ended one way or another.", "\n", "If forced to assault a castle, there were many options available to the attackers.

It does not, however, contain a pure copy of the Vulgate. There are numerous differences from the Vulgate, where ", " translations are used in lieu of Jerome's text. Although such variants are common in all the insular Gospels, there does not seem to be a consistent pattern of variation amongst the various insular texts. Evidence suggests that when the scribes were writing the text they often depended on memory rather than on their exemplar.\n", "The manuscript is written primarily in insular majuscule with some occurrences of ", " letters (usually ", " or ", ").

There are thirteen surviving full pages of decorated text including pages for the first few words of each of the Gospels. Eight of the ten pages of the canon tables have extensive decoration.

They are almost always shown together to emphasise the doctrine of the four Gospels' unity of message.\n", "The unity of the Gospels is further emphasised by the decoration of the Eusebian canon tables. The canon tables themselves inherently illustrate the unity of the Gospels by organising corresponding passages from the Gospels. The Eusebian canon tables normally require twelve pages. In the Book of Kells, the makers of the manuscript planned for twelve pages (folios 1v through 7r) but for unknown reasons, condensed them into ten, leaving folios 6v and 7r blank.

The Gospel of Luke contains two pages of fully decorated text (folio 188v, \"Fuit in diebus Herodis \", and ", ", \"Una autem sabbati valde\"). Although these texts do not have miniatures associated with them, it is probable that miniatures were planned to accompany each of these texts and have either been lost or were never completed. In the Gospel of John, there is no surviving full page of decorated text,  apart from its incipit. However, in the other three Gospels, all the full pages of decorated text, except for folio 188c, which begins the Nativity narration, occur within the Passion narrative.

Scattered through the text are decorated initials and small figures of animals and humans often twisted and tied into complicated knots. Many significant texts, such as the ", " have decorated initials. The page containing text of the ", " in Matthew (", ") has a large miniature along the left margin of the page in which the letter ", " which begins each line is linked into an ornate chain. The genealogy of Christ found in the Gospel of Luke (", ") contains a similar miniature in which the word ", " is repeatedly linked along the left margin. Many of the small animals scattered throughout the text serve to mark a \"turn-in-the-path\" (that is, a place where a line is finished in a space above or below the original line). Many other animals serve to fill spaces left at the end of lines. No two of these designs are the same. No earlier surviving manuscript has this massive amount of decoration.\n", "The decorations are all high quality and often highly complex.

This theory is further demonstrated by the external appearance of the adjoining stable block. More provincial, and less masterful in proportion, it is known to have been entirely the work of Stanton.", "\n", "The late 17th century in England was a time of great progress in design.

The new wave of architects such as Roger Pratt, ", ", and Sir ", " were not just building vast edifices in Renaissance-inspired styles, but also transforming existing older houses. Representative of the utilisation of older houses is ", " in ", ", where Pratt transformed the medieval, but now redundant, great hall into a classically inspired entrance hall complete with an ", ". Great Halls were considered redundant now that employers wished to live separately from their servants, and no longer ate with them in a Great Hall. All evidence and odours of cooking and staff were banished from the principal parts of the house. Employers began to live in fine airy rooms, above the ground floor, with privacy from their servants, who were now confined, unless required, to specifically delegated areas\u2014often the ground and uppermost attic floors. This was a period of great social change in British history, and the educated prided themselves on enlightenment and elegance.", "\n", "Belton was designed in the restrained almost ", "-inspired architecture of the time immediately before the full emergence in England of the ornate Baroque. The general form this architecture took was of severely symmetrical, often rectangular houses, with a ", " over the central bays. This almost rigid concept was to influence the design of innumerable houses, including Belton. Later to be known as the ", " style (from \"Carolus,\" the Latin name for the reigning monarch ", "), it was popular with the minor ", " and ", " for both their town and country houses until long after Charles II's death.", "\n", "Belton is faced with the local ", ", with a lighter ", " from ", " for the ", ".", " The \"H\"-shaped plan was a design which became popular in the late ", " period. However, by the late 16th century, domestic architecture had evolved further than the \"one room deep\" ranges of the earlier \"H\" plan houses, such as ", ". The new layout placed rooms back to back, creating a house two rooms deep. This became known as \"double pile\". As at Belton, this permitted rooms to be not just better lit and heated but also better accessed and related to each other, and with the greatest advantage of all\u2014greater privacy. On the construction side, the double room depth allowed the house to be more compact and under one, more easily constructed, roof, thus lowering building costs.\n", "The plan of the rooms at Belton was pass\u00e9 for a grand house of its time. Following the Restoration and the influx of European ideas, it had become popular for large houses to follow the continental fashion of a suite of ", " consisting of a ", ", dressing room, and bedroom proceeding from either side of a central ", " or hall.", " These rooms were permanently reserved for use by a high ranking guest, such as a visiting monarch. While Belton does have a saloon at its centre, ", " of state rooms of lessening grandeur do not flank it. The possible reason for this unusual layout is that, while the Brownlows possessed great wealth, their title was only a ", ", and their fortune was barely a century old. They would have been regarded as ", ", not ", ". As a result, building a suite of state rooms would have been in hope rather than anticipation of a royal guest. However, the lack of a fashionable and formal suite of ", " coupled with the Brownlows' lack of social credentials did not prevent a visit from King ", " to the newly completed house in 1695. The King occupied the \"Best bedchamber\", a large room with an adjoining closet, directly above the saloon, that led directly from the second floor Great Dining Chamber.", "\n", "This design followed the older style of having reception rooms and bedrooms scattered over the two main floors. The layout used followed Roger Pratt's theory that guest and family rooms should be quite separate.", " As a consequence of this philosophy, the family occupied the rooms on the first and second floors of the west and east wings, with the state rooms in the centre. The great staircase, designed to be grand and imposing, rose to the east side of the house, and formed part of the guest's state route from the Hall and Saloon on the first floor to the principal dining room and bedroom on the second.", "\n", "The principal entrance hall, reception and family bedrooms were placed on the ground and first floors above a low ", " containing service rooms.", " The two principal entrances to the mansion in the centre of both the north and south facades were accessed by external staircases, originally a single flared flight on the north side and a double staircase on the south, each of which have since been replaced by single broad flights of steps.", "\n", "The second floor has a matching ", ", with windows of equal value to those on the first floor below. The very latest innovation, ", ", was used on both floors. The semi-basement and ", " storey used the more old-fashioned ", " and ", " windows, indicating the lower status of the occupants of these floors. It was clearly emphasised from without that the two main floors of the house were purely for state and family use, and the staff and service areas were confined to the semi-basement and attic floors. This concept of keeping staff and domestic matters out of sight (when not required) was relatively new and had first been employed by Pratt in the design of ", " in Berkshire. The contemporary social commentator of the day ", " lauded back stairs, of which Belton has two examples (", " and ", " on plan), as one of the most important inventions of his day.", "\n", "The principal room is the large Marble Hall (", ") at the centre of the south front; this hall is the beginning of a grand procession of rooms, and corresponds to the former Great Parlour or ", " (", ") on the north front. The Marble Hall is flanked by the former Little Parlour (", ", now the Tapestry Room) and the Great Staircase (", "), while the Saloon is flanked by two withdrawing rooms (", ", ", "). The bedrooms are arranged in individual suites on both floors of the two wings (", ", ", ") that flank the state centre of the house. The main staircase, set to one side of the Marble Hall, is one of the few things at Belton which is asymmetrically placed. It has a robust plaster-work ceiling incorporating the Brownlow crest by the London plasterer Edward Goudge, \"now looked on as ye best master in England in his profession,\" William Winde reported in 1690.", "\n", "Bodily and spiritual needs were balanced symmetrically within the mansion: the kitchen (", ") and the chapel (", ") were both large two-storied halls, rising from the semi-basement to the first floor. This design not only provided a great and lofty space, but also allowed the servants to worship in the chapel without leaving the service floor, while their employers would worship from a private gallery, complete with fireplace, overlooking the chapel on the first floor.", "\n", "One of the most ", " features of the house is the ", " and ", " surmounting the roof, another element introduced to English architecture by Roger Pratt. The cupola at Belton does not light a lofty domed hall, as is often the case in Europe, but houses a staircase which gives access to a large viewing platform on top of a lead roof, concealed from the ground by the balustrade which tops the more conventional and visible ", " roof. From this vantage point, the owners of Belton could admire the perfect symmetry of their avenues and formal gardens spreading from the house. This feature of the house was removed by the architect ", " when he modernised the house in the 18th century.", " It was restored to its original form in the 1870s by the 3rd Earl Brownlow.", "\n", "Some of Belton's many rooms have been altered over the last 300 years both in use and design.

The panelling was introduced to the room by the 3rd Earl Brownlow in 1876, when it was furnished as the principal dining room of the mansion.

The stairs rise in three flights around the west, north, and east walls to the former Great Dining Room above the Marble Hall. Thus the staircase served as an important state procession link between the three principal reception rooms of the house.
