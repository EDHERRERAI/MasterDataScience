Most of the primary and secondary construction beams were of ponderosa pine. In addition to bulk materials, construction required other items in smaller quantities. Cordage was used for lashing roof elements together, and baskets and wood frames were needed for transporting ", " and rock. Other tools, such as digging sticks and hammerstones, were used in quantity; many discarded hammerstones have been found built into the wall interiors.", "\n", "Chetro Ketl's walls were constructed using three bulk materials: stone, clay-sand, and water. Two types of stone were used: a hard gray-brown tabular sandstone that forms the bench above Chaco Canyon's cliffs, and a softer, tan, massively bedded sandstone that forms the cliffs themselves. Chacoans preferred the harder, tabular stone as it was easier to shape, but much of it had to be dug up and levered out of the ground with wooden poles. Because the massive tan stone of the cliff faces was easier to procure, but much more difficult to work, the Chacoans probably used it only after the more easily quarried gray-brown stone beds had been depleted.", "\n", "The Chacoans used clay or clay-sand and water to make mud mortar. They obtained most of the material from canyon deposits, but some of the clays may have been collected from the base of the cliffs. Clay and clay-sand in soils or stream deposits were accessed by digging large pits, then mixing mortar in the pits and carrying the mix to the construction site in baskets. Water is scarce in Chaco Canyon and construction probably took place primarily during the late summer and early fall rainy season, when it was more readily available. Water was also collected from small reservoirs in the slick rock and deep wells in the bed of Chaco Wash.", "\n", "Only the most highly skilled Chacoans shaped and set stone; others carried supplies and mixed mortar. The width of a given wall was determined by its place in a structure. The first story of a two-story wall is always wider than the second. Chacoan walls are often called ", ", but only the widest walls had cores. The Chacoans tried to build walls with two flush faces, but because the stones were typically quite small, to build a wider wall they built up a space between the two faces; this spacing is often called the core. In most walls, the core consisted of roughly shaped stone or rubble laid at the same time as the two faces. In others, the faces were built up independently, and the core packed between them. Chacoan walls derive their stability from the degree of contact between stones in the faces and the width of the wall itself, not from the strength of the core.", "\n", "Chacoan wall faces are typically called \"veneers\", but they were integral load-bearing elements rather than decorative overlays. The veneers are known for their attention to coursing and detail, and various styles have become synonymous with Chacoan building. Depending on the facing style, the joints between the stones would be filled with ", " or chinks, set in mud mortar; or the coursing could alternate between larger stones and several courses of smaller tablets. Good veneer minimized the amount of exposed mortar, which reduced maintenance, maximized stone contact, and increased the strength of the wall. It also reduced the possibility of structural failure. Aside from structural considerations, some veneers are the result of highly skilled masons working within well-developed craft traditions. Recurring veneer patterns may indicate a widespread style used during a particular period, or they may suggest the work of a specific social group or line of builders.", "\n", "Doors and vents often had sills of carefully ground flat stone slabs and lintels constructed from a row of thin wood beams. Chacoan masons also frequently included intramural beams \u2013 horizontal logs completely enclosed in the wall core \u2013 which were probably intended to reduce horizontal deformation of the wall.", " The interior walls of great houses were typically covered in a rock veneer. Judd identified four distinct types, and his typology is the most commonly accepted in the region. Chetro Ketl's interior walls, particularly those in the eastern wing, were covered in a Type IV veneer characterized by uniform pieces of sandstone with little to no exposed mortar. Judd excluded a fifth type of masonry, called ", ", from his typology.", "\n", "In 1934, Florence Hawley used 143 tree-ring dates and a comparative masonry analysis to assemble a construction history of Chetro Ketl in three major periods: 945\u20131030, from which no significant elements are observable; 1030\u201390, when construction and remodeling produced most of the building's extant features; and 1100\u201316, which saw renovation of existing features.", " In 1983, comprehensive architectural studies by Lekson and McKenna and dendrochronological reanalysis by Dean and Warren largely verified Hawley's construction phases, with significant additions and clarifications.", " Lekson, Thomas C.

In the New Kingdom and later, the festival calendar at a single temple could include dozens of events, so it is likely that most of these events were observed only by the priests.", " In those festivals that involved a procession outside the temple, the local population also gathered to watch and to celebrate. These were the most elaborate temple ceremonies, accompanied by the recitation of hymns and the performance of musicians.", "\n", "Festival ceremonies entailed reenactment of mythological events or the performance of other symbolic acts, like the cutting of a sheaf of wheat during the harvest-related festival dedicated to the god ", ".", " Many of these ceremonies took place only within the temple building, such as the \"union with the sun disk\" festival practiced in the Late Period and afterward, when cult statues were carried to the temple roof at the start of the New Year to be enlivened by the rays of the sun. In festivals that involved a procession, priests carried the divine image out from the sanctuary, usually in its model barque, to visit another site. The barque might travel entirely on land or be loaded onto a real boat to travel on the river.", "\n", "The purpose of the god's visit varied. Some were tied to the ideology of kingship.

The enormous amounts of food listed in festival texts are unlikely to have been divided among the priests alone, so it is likely that the celebrating commoners also participated in the reversion of these offerings.", "\n", "Some temples kept sacred animals, which were believed to be manifestations of the temple god's ", " in the same way that cult images were. Each of these sacred animals was kept in the temple and worshipped for a certain length of time, ranging from a year to the lifetime of the animal.

Among the most prominent of these animals were the ", ", a ", " worshipped as a manifestation of the  ", " god ", ", and the falcon at Edfu who represented the falcon god Horus.", "\n", "During the Late Period, a different form of worship involving animals developed. In this case, laymen paid the priests to kill, mummify, and bury an animal of a particular species as an offering to a god. These animals were not regarded as especially sacred, but as a species, they were associated with the god because it was depicted in the form of that animal. The god ", ", for instance, could be depicted as an ", " and as a ", ", and both ibises and baboons were given to him.", " Although this practice was distinct from the worship of single divine representatives, some temples kept stocks of animals that could be selected for either purpose.", " These practices produced large cemeteries of mummified animals, such as the catacombs around the ", " where the Apis bulls were buried along with millions of animal offerings.", "\n", "By the beginning of the New Kingdom, and quite possibly earlier, the festival procession had become an opportunity for people to seek ", " from the god.

Priests interpreted the movements of sacred animals or, being asked questions directly, wrote out or spoke answers that they had supposedly received from the god in question.", " The priests' claim to speak for the gods or interpret their messages gave them great political influence and provided the means for the High Priests of Amun to dominate Upper Egypt during the Third Intermediate Period.", "\n", "Although they were excluded from the formal rituals of the temple, laymen still sought to interact with the gods. There is little evidence of the religious practices of individual people from early Egyptian history, so Egyptologists' understanding of the subject derives mostly from the New Kingdom or later periods.", " The evidence from those times indicates that while ordinary Egyptians used many venues to interact with the divine, such as household shrines or community chapels, the official temples with their sequestered gods were a major focus for popular veneration.", "\n", "Unable to address the cult image directly, laymen still attempted to convey their prayers to it. At times they related messages to priests to deliver to the temple deity; at other times they expressed their piety in the parts of the temple that they could access. Courts, doorways, and hypostyle halls might have spaces designated for public prayer.", " Sometimes people directed their appeals to the royal colossi, which were believed to act as divine intermediaries.", " More private areas for devotion were located at the building's outer wall, where large niches served as \"chapels of the hearing ear\" for individuals to speak to the god.", "\n", "The Egyptians also interacted with deities through the donation of offerings, ranging from simple bits of jewelry to large and finely carved statues and stelae.", " Among their contributions were statues that sat in temple courts, serving as memorials to the donors after their deaths and receiving portions of the temple offerings to sustain the donors' spirits. Other statues served as gifts to the temple god, and inscribed stelae conveyed to the resident deity the donors' prayers and messages of thanks. Over the centuries, so many of these statues accumulated within a temple building that priests sometimes moved them out of the way by burying them in caches beneath the floor.", " Commoners offered simple wooden or clay models as votives. The form of these models may indicate the reason for their donation. Figurines of women are among the most common types of votive figures, and some are inscribed with a prayer for a woman to bear a child.", "\n", "Festival processions offered a chance for laymen to approach and perhaps even glimpse the cult image in its barque, and for them to receive portions of the god's food.", " Because the key rituals of any festival still took place within the temple, out of public sight, Egyptologist Anthony Spalinger has questioned whether the processions inspired genuine \"religious feelings\" or were simply seen as occasions for revelry.", " In any case, the oracular events during festivals provided an opportunity for people to receive responses from the normally isolated deities, as did the other varieties of oracle that developed late in Egyptian history. Temples eventually became a venue for yet another type of divine contact: dreams. The Egyptians saw dreaming as a means of communion with the divine realm, and by the Ptolemaic period many temples provided buildings for ", ". People slept in these buildings in hopes of contacting the temple god. The petitioners often sought a magical solution to sickness or infertility. At other times they sought an answer to a question, receiving the answer through a dream rather than an oracle.", "\n", "After their original religious activities ceased, Egyptian temples suffered slow decay. Many were defaced by Christians trying to erase the remnants of ancient Egyptian religion.", " Some temple buildings, such as the ", " at Dendera or the hypostyle hall at Philae, were ", " or other types of buildings.", " Most commonly the sites were left disused, as at the Temple of ", " at ", ", while locals carried off their stones to serve as material for new buildings.", " The dismantling of temples for stone continued well into modern times.", " Limestone was especially useful as a source of ", ", so temples built of limestone were almost all dismantled. Sandstone temples, found mostly in Upper Egypt, were more likely to survive.", " What humans left intact was still subject to natural weathering. Temples in desert areas could be partly covered by drifts of sand, while those near the Nile, particularly in Lower Egypt, were often buried under layers of river-borne silt. Thus, some major temple sites like Memphis were reduced to ruin, while many temples far from the Nile and centers of population remained mostly intact.

The following day the rebels captured the castle's outer enclosure and the royal garrison retreated to the keep. Because the next day was Easter Sunday there was no fighting; hostilities resumed on the Monday. Siege engines were set up and targeted the keep. As in 1215 the keep proved resistant to missiles, and after a week had not succumbed. According to one contemporary source, the besiegers were about to dig a mine beneath the tower, but the siege was abandoned on 26 April when the earls received news of a relief force led by Henry\u00a0III and his son, Prince ", ".", "\n", "Though the garrison had held out within the keep, the rest of the castle had incurred severe damage, but no attempt was made to carry out repairs until the reign of ", " (1327\u20131377).

In 1281 John of Cobham, the constable, was granted permission to pull down the castle's hall and chambers which had been left as burnt-out ruins after the 1264 siege.

Palladio sometimes used a ", " as an alternative to the portico. This can most simply be described as a recessed portico, or an internal single storey room, with pierced walls that are open to the elements.

As the Palladian style swept Britain, all thoughts of mathematical proportion were swept away.

Palladian architecture in Ireland subtly differs from that in England.

Whatever the reason, Palladianism still had to be adapted for the wetter, colder weather.\n", "One of the most pioneering Irish architects was Sir ", " (1699\u20131733), who became one of the leading advocates of Palladianism in Ireland.

So much of Dublin was built in the 18th century that it set a ", " stamp on the city; however arising out of bad planning and poverty, until recently Dublin was one of the few cities where fine 18th-century housing could be seen in ruinous condition. Elsewhere in Ireland after 1922, the lead was removed from the roofs of unoccupied Palladian houses for its value as scrap, with the houses often abandoned owing to excessive roof-rate based taxes. Some roofless Palladian houses can still be found in the depopulated Irish countryside.\n", "Palladio's influence in North America", " is evident almost from the beginning of architect-designed building there, though the Irish philosopher ", " may have been America's pioneering Palladian.

The area was initially enclosed by a single bank and ditch, with the bank standing 2.7\u00a0m (8.9\u00a0ft) high although the ditch was shallow. The hill fort's expansion was not unique; it was one of a series of \"developed hill forts\" in southern England. As some hill forts were expanded, many of the smaller hill forts that had proliferated in the Early Iron Age fell out of use, as was the case in Dorset. The developed hill forts in Dorset were spaced widely apart. This, and the abandonment of the smaller hill forts in the area when the developed hill forts were built, indicates that these developed hill forts were important.", " The developed hill forts of Berkshire, Dorset, Hampshire, and Wiltshire were equally spaced apart, with roughly equal access to resources such as water.", "\n", "The emergence of developed hill forts has been attributed to Iron Age society becoming more complex.", " The emergence of one dominant hill fort in an area indicates that the inhabitants of a particular hill fort became more important than their contemporaries, possibly through warfare. However, a general dearth of evidence for destruction and an increase of artefacts associated with crafts and industry suggest that the reason for change was economic. Hill forts may have become important as centres of trade.", " This is supported by the possibility that the multiple rings of ditches often employed at developed hill forts (the technical term for which is \"", "\") were likely to be not just defensive; so many ditches and ramparts, such as those at Maiden Castle, were excessive for defence alone so were likely used as statements of power and authority.", " Developed hill forts were generally densely occupied; this is best demonstrated at Danebury, where 57% of the site has been excavated.", " While developed hill forts were of a higher status than their smaller predecessors, they were not all equal. Cunliffe states that the Maiden Castle's monumental defences probably indicate that it was of higher status than other developed hill forts.", "\n", "Maiden Castle expanded westwards, and the ditch was extended to enclose the neighbouring Hog Hill. The peaks of the two hills encompassed by the new, larger hill fort were separated by a ", ". A shaft dug into the valley was possibly used as a water source.", " Almost immediately after the single ditch enclosure was expanded to 19\u00a0ha (47 acres), work began on making the defences more elaborate. The existing rampart was heightened to 3.5\u00a0m (11\u00a0ft), and more ramparts and ditches were added. On the south of the fort, four ramparts and three ditches were added, but because of the steepness of the northern slope of the hill, the fourth rampart did not extend all the way round, and only three ramparts were built on the northern side. At the same time, the eastern entrance was again made more complex through the addition of further earthworks, lengthening the approach to the site.", "\n", "The four-post structures common in hill forts throughout England are also found in Maiden Castle. Their purpose on this site is uncertain however, since at 2\u00a0m (6.6\u00a0ft) square they have been considered by archaeologists to be too small for dwellings; as a result, it has been concluded that these structures were probably granaries.", " The presence of granaries suggests that the fort was used to control the area's food supply.", " Little evidence has been discovered for houses in Maiden Castle during the site's reconstruction in the 5th century\u00a0BC; this is probably because the site has not been fully excavated and a quarry used to provide material for the rampart may have obliterated the evidence.", " It appears that houses were not built near the ramparts until after the defences were complete.", " Maiden Castle was occupied throughout the Iron Age and its inhabitants lived in ", ". The later houses appear to be organised in rows, and to be roughly similar in size, a reorganisation which indicates the increasing power of the elites over Iron Age society.", "\n", "Bronze objects such as pins, jewellery, and rivets have been found on the site, dating from the Middle Iron Age. As there was no local source of tin and copper ore, this demonstrates long distance trade, probably with the southwest. Although bronze was not produced at Maiden Castle, there is evidence of it being reworked.", " Good quality iron ore could be found in the surrounding area, but the hill fort does not appear to have been a centre for iron production in this period; this is not unusual as very few hill forts in Berkshire, Dorset, Hampshire, and Wiltshire exhibit traces of iron production.", " Early in the Iron Age, most of the pottery found at Maiden Castle was produced locally\u00a0\u2013 within about 15\u00a0km (9.3\u00a0mi)\u00a0\u2013 however later on sources further afield became more important, and by the Late Iron Age 95% of the pottery came from the area around ", ", more than 35\u00a0mi (56\u00a0km) away.", " This long-range trade has been taken as evidence for increasing relationships with groups of people over large areas and the emergence of tribal identities.", " Although Sharples states that developed hill forts such as Maiden Castle are not towns and cannot be considered truly urban because they are so closely related to agriculture and storage,", " Cunliffe and fellow-archaeologists Mark Corney and Andrew Payne describe developed hill forts as \"town-like settlements\", a form of proto-urbanism.", "\n", "Across Britain, many hill forts fell out of use in the 100\u00a0years around the turn of the millennium.", " It has been suggested that this, and the contemporary change in material culture of the Britons (such as the introduction of coinage and cemeteries and an increase in craft industries), was caused by increased interaction with the ", ". The developing industries may have resulted in a shift away from the hill fort elites, whose power was based on agriculture.", " Such change is not as obvious in Dorset as it is in the rest of Britain, but there is a trend for abandonment of hill forts in the area and a proliferation of small undefended farmsteads, indicating a migration of the population.", "\n", "Around 100\u00a0BC, Maiden Castle's organised street pattern was replaced by more random habitation. At the same time, the western half of the site was abandoned and occupation was concentrated in the east of the fort.", " Also during the Late Iron Age, some of the earthworks around the eastern gateway were filled in and settlement expanded beyond the entrance, and into the areas between the banks. Excavations by archaeologist ", " in this area revealed several houses, storage pits, an area used for iron working, and a cemetery.", " On the industrial site, more than 62\u00a0kg (137\u00a0lb) of iron slag was discovered in an area of 30\u00a0m", " (320\u00a0sq\u00a0ft), and it is believed the site produced around 200\u00a0kg (440\u00a0lb) of iron.

However, there is little archaeological evidence to support this version of events, or even that the hill fort was attacked by the Romans.

It was the chosen style for numerous houses in both town and country, although Holkham is exceptional for both its severity of design and for being closer than most in its adherence to Palladio's ideals.\n", "Although Thomas Coke oversaw the project, he delegated the on-site architectural duties to the local Norfolk architect Matthew Brettingham, who was employed as the on-site clerk of works. Brettingham was already the estate architect, and was in receipt of ", "50 a year (about 8,000 pounds per year in 2020 terms", ") in return for \"taking care of his Lordship's buildings\".", " He was also influential in the design of the mansion, although he attributed the design of the Marble Hall to Coke himself. William Kent was mainly responsible for the interiors of the Southwest pavilion, or family wing block, particularly the Long Library. Kent produced a variety of alternative exteriors, suggesting a far richer decoration than Coke wanted. Brettingham described the building of Holkham as \"the great work of [my life]\", and when he published his \"The Plans and Elevations of the late Earl of Leicester's House at Holkham\", he immodestly described himself as sole architect, making no mention of Kent's involvement. However, in a later edition of the book, Brettingham's son admitted that \"the general idea was first struck out by the Earls of Leicester and Burlington, assisted by Mr. William Kent\".", "\n", "In 1734, the first foundations were laid; however, building was to continue for thirty years, until the completion of the great house in 1764.", "\n", "The Palladian style was admired by ", " such as Thomas Coke, who sought to identify themselves with the ", " of antiquity. Kent was responsible for the external appearance of Holkham; he based his design on Palladio's unbuilt Villa Mocenigo,", " as it appears in ", ", but with modifications.\n", "The plans for Holkham were of a large central block of two floors only, containing on the ", " level a series of symmetrically balanced ", " situated around two ", ". No hint of these courtyards is given externally; they are intended for lighting rather than recreation or architectural value.

Holkham is a Palladian house, and yet even by Palladian standards the external appearance is austere and devoid of ", ". This can almost certainly be traced to Coke himself. The on-site, supervising architect, Matthew Brettingham, related that Coke required and demanded \"commodiousness\", which can be interpreted as comfort. Hence rooms that were adequately lit by one window, had only one, as a second might have improved the external appearance but could have made a room cold or draughty. As a result, the few windows on the piano nobile, although symmetrically placed and balanced, appear lost in a sea of brickwork; albeit these yellow bricks were cast as exact replicas of ancient Roman bricks expressly for Holkham. Above the windows of the piano nobile, where on a true Palladian structure the windows of a ", " would be, there is nothing.

The palace was designed to provide an appropriate setting for the emperor's residence, the conduct of great affairs of state, and the accompanying ceremonies. While the residential function of the palace continued until the 12th century, the facilities built for grand state ceremonies began to fall into disuse by the 9th century. This was due to both the abandonment of several statutory ceremonies and procedures and the transfer of several remaining ceremonies into the smaller-scale setting of the Inner Palace.\n", "From the mid-Heian period, the palace suffered several fires and other disasters. During reconstructions, emperors and some of the office functions resided outside the palace. This, along with the general loss of political power of the court, acted to further diminish the importance of the palace as the administrative centre. Finally in 1227 the palace burned down and was never rebuilt. The site was built over so that almost no trace of it remains. Knowledge of the palace is thus based on contemporary literary sources, surviving diagrams and paintings, and limited excavations conducted mainly since the late 1970s.\n", "The palace was located at the northern centre of the rectangular Heian-ky\u014d, following the Chinese model (specifically that of the ", " capital of ", ") adopted already for the ", " in the earlier capital ", " (in present-day ", "), and ", ".

One reason may be the prevalent superstition of the period: uninhabited buildings were avoided for fear of spirits and ghosts, and even the great Buraku-in compound was thought to be haunted. In addition, the level of actual security maintained at the palace went into decline, and by the early 11th century only one palace gate, the Y\u014dmeimon in the east, appears to have been guarded. Hence burglary and even violent crime became a problem within the palace by the first half of 11th century.", "\n", "Fires were a constant problem as the palace compound was constructed almost entirely of wood.

These tables, which predate the text of the Vulgate, were developed to cross-reference the Gospels. Eusebius divided the Gospel into chapters and then created tables that allowed readers to find where a given episode in the life of Christ was located in each of the Gospels. The canon tables were traditionally included in the prefatory material in most medieval copies of the Vulgate text of the Gospels. The tables in the Book of Kells, however, are almost unusable because the scribe condensed the tables in such a way as to make them confused. In addition, the corresponding chapter numbers were never inserted into the margins of the text, making it impossible to find the sections to which the canon tables refer. The reason for the omission remains unclear: the scribe may have planned to add the references upon the manuscript's completion, or he may have deliberately left them out so as not to spoil the appearance of pages.", "\n", "The ", " and ", " belong to a pre-Vulgate tradition of manuscripts. The ", " are summaries of the ", " of the Gospels and are divided into numbered chapters. These chapter numbers, like the numbers for the canon tables, are not used on the text pages of the Gospels. It is unlikely that these numbers would have been used, even if the manuscript had been completed, because the chapter numbers corresponded to old Latin translations and would have been difficult to harmonise with the Vulgate text. The ", " are collections of legends about the Evangelists. The ", " and ", " are arranged in a strange order: first come the ", " and ", " for Matthew, followed by the ", " and ", " for Mark, then, quite oddly, come the ", " of both Luke and John, followed by their ", ". This anomalous order mirrors that found in the Book of Durrow, although in the latter instance, the misplaced sections appear at the very end of the manuscript rather than as part of a continuous preliminary.", " In other insular manuscripts, such as the ", ", the ", ", and the ", ", each Gospel is treated as a separate work and has its preliminaries immediately preceding it.", " The slavish repetition in Kells of the order of the ", " and ", " found in Durrow led scholar ", " to the conclusion that the scribe of Kells had either the Book of Durrow or a common model in hand.\n", "The Book of Kells contains the text of the four Gospels based on the ", ". It does not, however, contain a pure copy of the Vulgate. There are numerous differences from the Vulgate, where ", " translations are used in lieu of Jerome's text. Although such variants are common in all the insular Gospels, there does not seem to be a consistent pattern of variation amongst the various insular texts. Evidence suggests that when the scribes were writing the text they often depended on memory rather than on their exemplar.\n", "The manuscript is written primarily in insular majuscule with some occurrences of ", " letters (usually ", " or ", "). The text is usually written in one long line across the page. ", " identified at least three scribes in this manuscript, whom she named Hand A, Hand B, and Hand C.", " Hand A is found on folios 1 through 19v, folios 276 through 289, and folios 307 through the end of the manuscript. Hand A, for the most part, writes eighteen or nineteen lines per page in the brown ", " common throughout the West.", " Hand B is found on folios 19r through 26 and folios 124 through 128. Hand B has a somewhat greater tendency to use minuscule and uses red, purple and black ink and a variable number of lines per page. Hand C is found throughout the majority of the text. Hand C also has greater tendency to use minuscule than Hand A. Hand C uses the same brownish gall ink used by hand A and wrote, almost always, seventeen lines per page.", "\n", "There are several ", " between the text and the accepted Gospels. In the ", ", which starts at Luke 3:23, Kells names an extra ancestor.", "  At ", ", a common English translation reads \"I came not to send peace, but a sword\".  However, the manuscript reads ", " (\"joy\") where it should read ", " (\"sword\"), thus translating as \"I came not [only] to send peace, but joy.\"", "  The lavishly decorated opening page of the Gospel according to John had been deciphered by George Bain as: \"In principio erat verbum verum\"", " [In the beginning was the True Word]. Therefore, the incipit is a free translation into Latin of the ", " original ", " rather than a mere copy of the Roman version.\n", "The text is accompanied by many full-page ", ", while smaller painted decorations appear throughout the text in unprecedented quantities. The decoration of the book is famous for combining intricate detail with bold and energetic compositions. The characteristics of the insular manuscript initial, as described by Carl Nordenfalk, here reach their most extreme realisation: \"the initials ... are conceived as elastic forms expanding and contracting with a pulsating rhythm. The kinetic energy of their contours escapes into freely drawn appendices, a spiral line which in turn generates new curvilinear motifs...\".", " The illustrations feature a broad range of colours, with purple, lilac, red, pink, green, and yellow being the colours most often used. Earlier manuscripts tend toward more narrow palettes: the Book of Durrow, for example, uses only four colours. As is usual with insular work, there was no use of ", " or ", " in the manuscript. The ", " for the illustrations included red and yellow ochre, green copper pigment (sometimes called ", "), indigo, and possibly ", ".", " These would have been imported from the Mediterranean region and, in the case of the lapis lazuli (also known as ", "), from northeast ", ".", " Though the presence of lapis lazuli has long been considered evidence of the great cost required to create the manuscript, recent examination of the pigments has shown that lapis lazuli was not used.", "\n", "The lavish illumination programme is far greater than any other surviving Insular Gospel book.

There are thirteen surviving full pages of decorated text including pages for the first few words of each of the Gospels. Eight of the ten pages of the canon tables have extensive decoration. It is highly probable that there were other pages of miniature and decorated text that are now lost. In addition to these major pages, there are a host of smaller decorations and decorated initials throughout the text; in fact only two pages have no decoration.", "\n", "The extant folios of the manuscript start with the fragment of the glossary of Hebrew names. This fragment occupies the left-hand column of folio 1r. A miniature of the four evangelist symbols, now much abraded, make up the right-hand column. The miniature is oriented so that the volume must be turned ninety degrees to view it properly.", " The four evangelist symbols are a visual theme that runs throughout the book. They are almost always shown together to emphasise the doctrine of the four Gospels' unity of message.\n", "The unity of the Gospels is further emphasised by the decoration of the Eusebian canon tables. The canon tables themselves inherently illustrate the unity of the Gospels by organising corresponding passages from the Gospels. The Eusebian canon tables normally require twelve pages. In the Book of Kells, the makers of the manuscript planned for twelve pages (folios 1v through 7r) but for unknown reasons, condensed them into ten, leaving folios 6v and 7r blank. This condensation rendered the canon tables unusable. The decoration of the first eight pages of the canon tables is heavily influenced by early Gospel Books from the Mediterranean, where it was traditional to enclose the tables within an ", " (as seen in the ", ").", " The Kells manuscript presents this ", " in an Insular spirit, where the arcades are not seen as architectural elements but rather become stylised geometric patterns with Insular ornamentation. The four evangelist symbols occupy the spaces under and above the arches. The last two canon tables are presented within a grid. This presentation is limited to Insular manuscripts and was first seen in the Book of Durrow.", "\n", "The remainder of the book is broken into sections with the divisions set off by miniatures and full pages of decorated text.

The Gospel of Mark is missing the Evangelist portrait but retains its Evangelist symbols page (", "). The Gospel of Luke is missing both the portrait and the Evangelist symbols page.

However, in the other three Gospels, all the full pages of decorated text, except for folio 188c, which begins the Nativity narration, occur within the Passion narrative.

The plan was that Pepys would edit and publish the already famous story, but he never did so. It is also known that Pepys was planning to write a history of the navy and that he was gathering material for this task, but this project also was never finished. It is considered likely that King Charles was aware of Pepys' plans and presented him with two of the rolls either as a gift or as payment for the intended publication of the escape story. The second roll could not be located at that time, and it was not until 1690 that it was discovered by Henry Thynne, keeper of the royal library 1677\u201389 and a close friend of Pepys. Thynne arranged for Pepys to make copies of some of the illustrations, but by 1690 Charles was dead and James II was in exile. Pepys had resigned from his position as Secretary of the Admiralty that same year and refused to recognize the reign of ", " and ", ", which meant that acquisition of the final roll for his collection was out of the question. The creation of the codex from the first and third rolls is therefore assumed to have been completed shortly after that time.

It exists today in the form of a bound volume containing the first and third rolls while the second roll is preserved in its original form. The three original rolls were made up out of a total of 17 individual membranes glued to the back of the next membrane. The membranes were of a width of ", " inches (70\u00a0cm) and a height varying from 31 to ", " inches (79 to 96\u00a0cm).", " After receiving the first and third rolls Pepys had his clerks cut the rolls up and bound in a single volume as a book, now known as ", ". The transformation of the two rolls created a horizontal page structure, and some of the ornamentation that was cut in process was copied into the volume by hand. Pepys also inserted abstracts between the two rolls and a summarizing table that was not Anthony's, but pre-dated Pepys' binding of the rolls. This radical treatment of the original document has damaged some of the illustrations and is today deprecated. The first three illustrations of the ", ", ", " and ", " were all too large to fit on one page and were therefore converted to two-page spreads. The resulting bend down the centre of the illustrations led to noticeable loss of detail. Despite this, there are no plans to attempt a recreation of the original structure of the first and third rolls.

The picture of the ship has provided clues about basic structural features, such as the number of masts and sails. When compared with an inventory of the ship from 1514, there is a close match, proving the illustration to be largely accurate. Examination of details in the construction, however, reveals that Anthony allowed himself some artistic licence. The armament in the painted ship appears clearly exaggerated. The heavy stern chasers (cannon placed in the stern aimed backwards) mounted through gun ports on the ", ", just about the waterline, would not have been feasible because of the lack of an orlop deck and the steep angle (sheer) of the ship in this area. The number of gunports in the broadside is inaccurate since it implies two slightly staggered rows of nine ports while the surviving starboard side of the ", " has only one row of gunports on the main deck with seven ports. The accuracy of the ", " has been more difficult to ascertain since none of it remains; conflicting interpretations of what it looked like have been suggested.", "\n", "The guns in the back of the forecastle have defied explanation, but one theory is that they were included to compensate for the guns that were positioned in the ", ", aiming forwards, but which would have been obscured due to the angle from which the ship was depicted.", " The list of ammunition, small firearms, ", ", arrows, pikes, and ", " closely matches the archaeological evidence.", " As the source that is closest in time to the sinking of the ", ", it has been of central importance for the archaeological project, especially in estimating the size of the crew.", "\n", "The Anthony Roll provides detailed information about the flags used on the ships.

Great Halls were considered redundant now that employers wished to live separately from their servants, and no longer ate with them in a Great Hall.

Employers began to live in fine airy rooms, above the ground floor, with privacy from their servants, who were now confined, unless required, to specifically delegated areas\u2014often the ground and uppermost attic floors. This was a period of great social change in British history, and the educated prided themselves on enlightenment and elegance.", "\n", "Belton was designed in the restrained almost ", "-inspired architecture of the time immediately before the full emergence in England of the ornate Baroque. The general form this architecture took was of severely symmetrical, often rectangular houses, with a ", " over the central bays. This almost rigid concept was to influence the design of innumerable houses, including Belton. Later to be known as the ", " style (from \"Carolus,\" the Latin name for the reigning monarch ", "), it was popular with the minor ", " and ", " for both their town and country houses until long after Charles II's death.", "\n", "Belton is faced with the local ", ", with a lighter ", " from ", " for the ", ".", " The \"H\"-shaped plan was a design which became popular in the late ", " period.

As at Belton, this permitted rooms to be not just better lit and heated but also better accessed and related to each other, and with the greatest advantage of all\u2014greater privacy. On the construction side, the double room depth allowed the house to be more compact and under one, more easily constructed, roof, thus lowering building costs.\n", "The plan of the rooms at Belton was pass\u00e9 for a grand house of its time.

While Belton does have a saloon at its centre, ", " of state rooms of lessening grandeur do not flank it. The possible reason for this unusual layout is that, while the Brownlows possessed great wealth, their title was only a ", ", and their fortune was barely a century old. They would have been regarded as ", ", not ", ". As a result, building a suite of state rooms would have been in hope rather than anticipation of a royal guest. However, the lack of a fashionable and formal suite of ", " coupled with the Brownlows' lack of social credentials did not prevent a visit from King ", " to the newly completed house in 1695. The King occupied the \"Best bedchamber\", a large room with an adjoining closet, directly above the saloon, that led directly from the second floor Great Dining Chamber.", "\n", "This design followed the older style of having reception rooms and bedrooms scattered over the two main floors. The layout used followed Roger Pratt's theory that guest and family rooms should be quite separate.", " As a consequence of this philosophy, the family occupied the rooms on the first and second floors of the west and east wings, with the state rooms in the centre. The great staircase, designed to be grand and imposing, rose to the east side of the house, and formed part of the guest's state route from the Hall and Saloon on the first floor to the principal dining room and bedroom on the second.", "\n", "The principal entrance hall, reception and family bedrooms were placed on the ground and first floors above a low ", " containing service rooms.", " The two principal entrances to the mansion in the centre of both the north and south facades were accessed by external staircases, originally a single flared flight on the north side and a double staircase on the south, each of which have since been replaced by single broad flights of steps.", "\n", "The second floor has a matching ", ", with windows of equal value to those on the first floor below. The very latest innovation, ", ", was used on both floors. The semi-basement and ", " storey used the more old-fashioned ", " and ", " windows, indicating the lower status of the occupants of these floors. It was clearly emphasised from without that the two main floors of the house were purely for state and family use, and the staff and service areas were confined to the semi-basement and attic floors. This concept of keeping staff and domestic matters out of sight (when not required) was relatively new and had first been employed by Pratt in the design of ", " in Berkshire. The contemporary social commentator of the day ", " lauded back stairs, of which Belton has two examples (", " and ", " on plan), as one of the most important inventions of his day.", "\n", "The principal room is the large Marble Hall (", ") at the centre of the south front; this hall is the beginning of a grand procession of rooms, and corresponds to the former Great Parlour or ", " (", ") on the north front.

The bedrooms are arranged in individual suites on both floors of the two wings (", ", ", ") that flank the state centre of the house. The main staircase, set to one side of the Marble Hall, is one of the few things at Belton which is asymmetrically placed. It has a robust plaster-work ceiling incorporating the Brownlow crest by the London plasterer Edward Goudge, \"now looked on as ye best master in England in his profession,\" William Winde reported in 1690.", "\n", "Bodily and spiritual needs were balanced symmetrically within the mansion: the kitchen (", ") and the chapel (", ") were both large two-storied halls, rising from the semi-basement to the first floor. This design not only provided a great and lofty space, but also allowed the servants to worship in the chapel without leaving the service floor, while their employers would worship from a private gallery, complete with fireplace, overlooking the chapel on the first floor.", "\n", "One of the most ", " features of the house is the ", " and ", " surmounting the roof, another element introduced to English architecture by Roger Pratt. The cupola at Belton does not light a lofty domed hall, as is often the case in Europe, but houses a staircase which gives access to a large viewing platform on top of a lead roof, concealed from the ground by the balustrade which tops the more conventional and visible ", " roof. From this vantage point, the owners of Belton could admire the perfect symmetry of their avenues and formal gardens spreading from the house.

The panelling was introduced to the room by the 3rd Earl Brownlow in 1876, when it was furnished as the principal dining room of the mansion. The room was initially created as a library in 1808 from the upper part of the earlier kitchen which had originally risen two stories.", " The West staircase (", ") was originally a service stairs, and would have been plainer in decor, but by the late nineteenth century it was in regular use by the family.", "\n", "Either side of the Marble Hall, lie the ", " (", ") and the ", " (", "), which contains a collection of early eighteenth century ", ".

Thus the staircase served as an important state procession link between the three principal reception rooms of the house.
